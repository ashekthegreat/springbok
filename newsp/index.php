                                Your local estate agent says the property market's in a slump. The papers say the recession's not
                                over yet. The same houses on the market every week for months and months says that it's the worst time to sell.
                            </p>

                            <p>We say that's rubbish &ndash; the property market just needs our progressive approach!</p>

                                Springbok Properties offers a market-beating alternative to the traditional way of selling

                                no matter how bad the market may look.
