                            <h2>Do you want to put your Aberdeen property up for sale? Or do you want to sell it?</h2>

                            <p>The traditional local high street estate agent says the property market’s in a slump.
                                The Aberdeen papers say the recession’s not over yet. The same houses on the market
                                every week for months and months say that it’s the worst time to sell.</p>

                            <p>We say that's rubbish &ndash; the property market just needs our progressive approach!</p>

                            <p>We don’t want to put your house on the market. We don’t want to advertise it.
                                We don’t want to test the market to judge the level of interest. We don’t want to
                                organise lots of viewings to see if someone might buy.</p>

                            <h2>We want to sell your property. Right now. For the best price.</h2>

                            <p>Springbok Properties offers a market-beating alternative to the traditional way of selling.
