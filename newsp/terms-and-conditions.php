Any correspondence or contracts should make clear to you where applicable the licensee or legal entity that will enter the contract with you before you enter the contract. The words “we”, “us” or “our” in these terms refer to the local licensee in your area or, if there is none, then to Yellow Springbok.</p>

However, you accept that this website is for guidance only and does not in any way form part of a contract.
