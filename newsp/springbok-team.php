                            <p><strong>Springbok Properties offers a market-beating alternative to the traditional way of selling property.</strong></p>

                            <p>Springbok grew from 5 people selling 4 properties a month in March 2012 to 78 people selling 180 properties a month in July 2014. How did we get so big, so quickly? It’s simple. Our entire organisation revolves around our dedication to a single mission – to meet our customers’ primary need:</p>

                            <p><strong>We provide the best customer service humanly possible, and sell your property on your timescale, with the best possible price.</strong></p>

                            <p>At Springbok, customer service isn’t a department: it’s a job requirement for every single employee.</p>
