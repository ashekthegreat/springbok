                            <p>Springbok Properties strives to provide a high standard of service to all our customers at all times. If you feel we have not achieved this in any way, we’d really like you to tell us.</p>
                            <h3>If You Have a Complaint</h3>
                            <p>If you’re not happy for any reason, your first point of contact should be with the team handling the sale of the property. It doesn’t matter if you are the vendor, a prospective buyer or you have purchased the property through us. The team you have been dealing with will get started on resolving any issues as soon as they are aware of the problem.</p>
                            <p>If they can’t help, they will escalate you complaint within our internal complaint procedures. You will be contacted by a manager or assistant manager the same day if we can.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes a complaint can be complex, or requires some investigation on our part. You may feel you would like to make your complaint more formal. If that is the case, please feel free to contact us by email or post.</p>

                            <p>To help us get to the bottom of things quickly and allow us to provide you with a speedy response, it would really help if you could give us as much information as possible about your problem.

                            <p>We will acknowledge your complaint within three working days, and let you know when you should receive our full and final response. We may contact you for more information in the meantime to help make the right decision.</p>
                            <p>If you are unhappy with our final decision, you may contact the Ombudsman who will then be able to independently review your complaint and our response. More information can be found on their website or by contacting them directly.</p>
