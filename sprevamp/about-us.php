                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Actually the most amazing experience we have ever had, <b>these guys are not 'estate agents' in the true sense of the word</b> - they are totally on your side, totally human, and fantastic. Every part of the process from the valuation to completion was exceptional. <b>I can't sing their praises enough</b>. The house was on the <b>market for a matter of days before we had offers</b> on the table, and in this market that's just awesome! We were <b>on the market with another estate agent for months without even a bite, and now look at us, sold, done, dusted</b> with no drama and on our way to the sunshine!! I would highly recommend Springbok, every member of staff a delight, the process easy and the results AMAZEBALLS!!! Thank you to everyone at Springbok"</p>

                    <p>"Really good service. Matthew got back to me within an hour of calling to enquire about the property and managed to get me a viewing <b>within 2 hours, on the day I called (Sunday).</b> Lauren kept me up to date with every step of the sale and sometimes even more than my solicitor! Excellent and friendly service and I would definitely recommend this company."</p>

                    <p>"I was very happy with the service I received from Springbok. They were pro-active with their aim of pushing through the sale as quickly as possible. I was contacted every few days to discuss where I was personally with the sale, and provided with updates regarding solicitors and the seller. Kate was always extremely friendly and polite and easy to deal with."</p>

                    <p>"I would recommend this company to anyone wishing to sell their property quickly without any fuss. My property had been for sale for 2 years with conventional estate agents, and I was disillusioned and very disappointed with their lack of results. Springbok were <b>professional from the start, providing regular updates and advice</b>. All the stress of dealing with the actual sale was handled by them, too. <b>I would use them again without a second thought</b>. Thank you so much!</p>

Both Lee and Natalie, who dealt with me, were helpful, courteous and <b>kept me informed of what was happening every step of the way</b>. They made what can be a worrying and stressful process a lot, lot easier. I would recommend anyone thinking of selling their property to use them."</p>

                    <p>"I recently sold my house using Springbok. The service I received was excellent, everything was explained to me very carefully prior to signing a contract with them, the For Sale sign went up on a Saturday, we had an unsuccessful viewing on the Monday, and again on the Tuesday, but on Wednesday a couple viewed who immediately loved the house. They came back again the following Saturday and put an offer in which we rejected. They came back 2 days later with another offer which we accepted, all done within 2 weeks, everything went through very smoothly. <b>Both parties were very happy with the speedy outcome, would not hesitate to recommend Springbok to family and friends</b>. All members of staff I had dealings with were very helpful, particularly Jenna."</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"After attempting to purchase 2 properties<b> through other estate agents and spending the whole time feeling I was either being constantly misled or ignored (or both at once), </b>I stumbled on a property where the agent just happened to be Springbok Properties. What luck!</p>
                    <p><b>I must say that I don't ever go out of my way to write a review for anything less than exceptional service, which is exactly what I received from start to finish whilst purchasing a property via Springbok</b>. At no point did I feel like anybody at Springbok was doing anything other than being <b>100% honest (which is hard to find in an estate agent)</b> and whatever my query was, I would ring them and they would always do everything to help me out as quickly as possible. Whenever I spoke to anybody, I felt like they were there to help me with whatever I wanted (as opposed to other estate agents where every time I spoke to them it felt like they were only there to fill their pockets or say anything to get me off the phone in the hope somebody else picked up next time).</p>
                    <p>Overall, I would give Springbok 9/10 (Although I would give Natalie, who took ownership of the property I was purchasing part way through, a 10/10). When me and my partner both get promoted and feel it's time to upgrade to a new house, I honestly cannot see myself looking to anywhere other than Springbok to deal with the purchase/sale.<b> Thank you Springbok for making what can be a very stressful period in life as easy as possible</b>."</p>
