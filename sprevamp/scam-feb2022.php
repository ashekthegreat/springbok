                <p>Selling your house is not only time consuming, but it's also frustrating. And that is enough reason to
                    turn to a 'we buy any house' company. The thought of completing a sale in just 7 days is often irresistible.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, this industry struggles to shake off a bad image from companies that are fraudsters.</p>

                <p>For this reason alone, it's important to know what to look out for in a legitimate quick house sale
                    company so that you don't fall into the hands of scammers.</p>

                <h5 class="margin-top-40">Here, we'll explain to you the following:</h5>

                <ul class="teal-bullet margin-bottom-50">
                    <li>The truth about the quick house sale industry</li>

                </ul>

                <h5>The truth about the 'we buy any house' industry</h5>

                <p>The 'we buy any house' industry is full of scammers and fake cash buyers. That's why we're taking the
                    step to guide you, so you know how to identify trustworthy buyers and avoid scammers.</p>

                <p>There are hundreds of quick house sale companies in the UK with most of them offering to buy your
                property for cash along with the promise of completing the sale process fast. These companies will
                usually make an offer of no more than 85% of the actual value of your home. Some companies may
                    even go lower.</p>

                <img src="images/avoid-scam/house.jpg" width="503" height="335" class="right" alt="Can you trust 'we buy any house' companies" loading="lazy">
                <h5>Can you trust 'we buy any house' companies?</h5>

                <p>The 'we buy any house' industry is legitimate even though a government body does not regulate it, thus exposing consumers. Although most
                companies in this industry are genuine, the dealings are such that no company will buy your house for its full value.</p>

                <p>The reason for this is simple...</p>

                <p>Buyers will need to put in work before selling the
                property. But all is not lost. As a consumer, you can draw confidence from the fact that quick house
                sale companies that are serious about offering trusted service will subscribe to the National
                Association of Property Buyers (NAPB). This means registering with the Property Ombudsman (TPOS)
                too. As such, they must comply with their code of practice. Moreover, you'll have a platform for seeking
                redress in case there's a dispute.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, the industry has scammers too.</p>

                <p>We have been putting together a list to help you spot the scammers because you must do due diligence
                    when choosing a 'we buy any house' company.</p>

                <h5>How do quick house sale companies work?</h5>

                <p>Although they lack proper regulation, genuine 'we buy any house' companies will buy your house with
                    this 5-step process:</p>

                <ol class="teal-numbered">
                    <li>You first contact them, to which they respond with a cash offer</li>
                    <li>If you accept the offer, they'll take care of all transactions at no cost to you</li>
                    <li>A legit quick house sale company will cover the legal fees</li>
                    <li>If you agree on the proposed completion date, they'll work towards completing the sale</li>
                    <li>The sale will go through as scheduled and you'll receive money in your bank account</li>

                <p>Fake quick house sale companies will often disguise their motive so it's difficult to tell if they are genuine.
                    That's why we're revealing five of the common scams you must look out for:</p>

                <ol class="teal-numbered">
                    <li>
                        <h5>Gazumping</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">This is the most common trick illegitimate companies will use to get you to sell your house to them.
                        Questionable companies will often give you an unrealistic offer and even promise to complete the
                        transaction in just a couple of days pending a valuation. However, they'll renegotiate once the
                        valuation is complete with an unrealistic drop in the offer, usually at the 11th hour, when the only
                            option you have is to accept the new offer. A legitimate company will establish the price.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Lead generation scam</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">It'll surprise you to know that many companies, while purporting to buy your house, are just
                        interested in making money from the sale of your data. They use their sites to generate leads by
                            getting you to sign up for more details on their site only for them to sell your data to third parties.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>False Valuations</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">This is the most common trick illegitimate companies will use to get you to sell your house to them.
                        Questionable companies will often give you an unrealistic offer and even promise to complete the

                        <h5>Hidden fees</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Bogus 'we buy any house' companies will want
                        to make money through hidden fees relating to the sale of your property. They will not tell you
                        about these fees and only mention on the completion day when you can't realistically
                        back off from the sale. Genuine companies will cover the legal costs and won't charge you any fees.</p>

                        <p class="margin-top-0">Fraudulent quick house sale companies will tactically lock you into an agreement such that you can't
                        sell your property to another party if you change your mind. As for the 'option' trick, they  will give you
                        a contract with clauses that gives them the liberty to sell your property through a third party. The
                        'option' clause may also give room for assisted sales or the option to lease, which doesn't guarantee
                            a sale. If anything, it may only result in additional fees.</p>

                        <p>In the worst-case scenario, 'we buy any house' companies will not have the cash to buy your home,
                        even though they'll claim otherwise. Genuine companies will have cash at hand to buy your home fast
                        so that you can solve any issue you're facing.  So, next time a quick sale company promises the world,
                            think twice before signing the contract.</p>

                        <p class="margin-top-0">A genuine 'we buy any house' company will also be members of the National Association of
                        Property Buyers (NAPB) as well as the Property Ombudsman (TPO). They will readily display this
                        information on their website. Other important membership that credible quick sale companies

                        <h5>Do a little research on the company</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Don't just commit to selling your house to the first company you find. Instead, spend time
                        looking up some information about them. More specifically, you should be keen on the
                        companies trading history. They should also display their registration number on their website.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Check for recent independent reviews</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">It's common for any company to have customer
                        testimonials from past clients on their site. Sometimes these are curated so that they may not be
                        an accurate representation of what clients say. Check out for recent independent reviews of the
                        company on sites like Google, TrustPilot and Reviews.co.uk. These will give you an accurate picture
                        of what you can expect if you choose to sell your house to them. If you find a company with little
                        to no reviews or reviews that are not up to date, then this may just a red flag. Having too many
                        reviews within a brief period may also point to falsified content.</p>

                        <h5>Ask for proof of funds</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">The idea behind quick sale companies is that
                            they buy property for cash. But it is risky to work with an assumption that the company
                            has cash ready to buy your house. Go further and request that they prove their availability
                            of funds soon after they give you an offer. Most serious companies will not have a
                            problem sharing their financial statement.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Clarify on any fees</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Equally important is the issue of fees. Ask the 'we buy any house' company to come clean on any
                            charges they're proposing. Ideally, most legit companies will not charge you any fees. Instead,
                            they will cover all the legal costs; hence the reason for making an offer of 85% of the value of
                            your property.</p>
                    </li>

                        <h5>Is the timeframe or offer too good to believe?</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Sometimes you have to trust your gut instinct in identifying 'we buy any house' scams. When
                            a company gives you an offer that is too good to be true, take a step back and evaluate the
                            possibility of it being a scam. For instance, where a company offers to pay the equivalent
                            of 100% value for your home or they promise to complete the sale in 3 days, start questioning their legitimacy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Request the solicitor's details</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Sometimes it is the company's solicitor that will help you steer clear from trouble. Therefore,
                            request their details so you can contact them to verify that the company is genuine. If the company
                            refuses to divulge this information or can't provide details of the conveyancer, just walk away
                            before it's too late. Alternatively, have an independent legal advisor to guide you through the
                            entire process.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Sell your house through an estate agent</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">This is the best move you can make to avoid being conned by 'we buy any house' companies.
                            However, you must remember the reason you opted for the quick sale company in the first place.
                            While it's true that you won't be scammed and will sell your property for close to its true value,
                            this could take a long time to find a suitable buyer and close a sale. So, ask the agent about the
                            possibility of selling your house at an auction, as this may be the quickest way. Most importantly,
                            make sure you're working with a proactive estate agent with a reputation for selling properties
                            fast.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h5>Ask to see the valuation report</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Certain 'we buy any house' companies will undervalue your property so that in the end you're
                            getting far less than the value of your property. As such, you'll do well to request to see the
                            valuation report just to be certain. You can even have estate agents offering you three different
                            valuations for comparison. Quick house sale companies that undervalue your property will not
                            want you to see the report.</p>
                    </li>

                        <h5>Don't be in a rush to sign the agreement.</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">The devil is in the detail. Bogus 'we buy any house' companies will want you to sign the
                            agreement quickly so you don't get to read the details. Our advice is don't sign until
                            you have read and understood the agreement and have done all the legal checks. Where
                            possible, ask your solicitor to explain anything you may not be clear about. You must be sure
                            about what you're signing up for.</p>

                        <p class="margin-top-0">A legitimate and professional house buying company will buy your house within 7- 28 days.
                            Many bogus companies claim to complete the purchase in 24 hours. Such claims should
                            serve as a red flag. If anything, the shady companies posing as legitimate 'we buy any house'
                            companies will drag the sale for months as they try to find a buyer or secure funds.

                            company claiming to offer more is suspect. Don't fall for their tricks. </p>

                        <h5>Are there any other costs to expect when selling to a reputable house buying company?</h5>
                        <p class="margin-top-0">Reputable home buying companies will not charge you any fees to buy your property. They
                            will even pay your legal fee. The reasoning here is that they cover these costs before
                            extending to you an offer, which explains why you'll not get a 100% offer. Avoid companies
                            that want you to make any upfront payment. </p>

                        <p class="margin-top-0">No, unfortunately this industry is not regulated so you should be suspicious if you come
                            across someone or a company that claims otherwise. However, this is not a reason to scare
                            you off. If you follow the 10 tips to avoid scams, you can be sure to protect yourself from shady
