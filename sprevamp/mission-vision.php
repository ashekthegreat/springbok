At no point did I feel like anybody at Springbok was doing anything other than being 100% honest (which is hard to find in an estate agent) and whatever my query was, I would ring them and they would always do everything to help me out as quickly as possible. Whenever I spoke to anybody, I felt like they were there to help me with whatever I wanted (as opposed to other estate agents where every time I spoke to them it felt like they were only there to fill their pockets or say anything to get me off the phone in the hope somebody else picked up next time)."

I was absolutely amazed when the day after, they contacted me, they spent time explaining how they worked, reassured me about selling my home and buying the home I am now in. I felt totally laid back as the wheels where set in motion. Springbok were true to their word my move was stress free they sold my home and helped me buy this one. I wish I'd known about them when I'd moved home before. Thank you all, not only for helping me move, but for your patience and speed in resolving my worries. :-))"

                                            "Right from my first contact with the company, everything was done smoothly and professionally. First I met with the regional valuer Julian who was great to deal with, answered my questions honestly, and explained the process from start to finish in plain English. When the property was listed I dealt with Adam. Adam was constantly on the phone updating me with all offers on the property, fitting bookings around my schedule and great with just basic advice. To conclude the sale I was passed to Natalie. Natalie chased up every aspect of the sale quickly and efficiently and was first class to deal with. Can't fault the company one bit, and having dealing previously with a high street estate agent before moving to Springbok I can say that the service on offer is head and shoulders above everything I have previously experienced. The main points to highlight is that at no time are you under any pressure to sell or except offers unless it's on your terms and also if you don't sell you have nothing to pay......so what you got to lose giving it a try???"

                                            "I moved to Springbok Properties after 6 months with another Estate Agent who promised a very proactive sale process but did not deliver, despite expensive glossy brochures and costs!! I found the sales side to be very proactive and I was kept updated on a 2 weekly basis. It was a difficult property to sell as it was a flat over a pub so took some 4 months to find a buyer. Once an offer was made I was transferred to a sales progressor who pushed the purchase process with the buyer and solicitors. I was kept up to date with progress on a regular basis and advised of any issues. All in all, a very efficient and friendly service from start to end. Highly recommended."
