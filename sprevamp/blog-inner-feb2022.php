                </h1>

                <p>If you've missed your mortgage repayments and have payments overdue, then you are 'in arrears'. If you are unable to agree a way of paying your arrears, your lender might ask a court for what is called a 'possession order'. This enables them to sell your home and use the money from the sale to recover the money you owe.</p>

                <p>And if you're reading this, it's likely that you're in arrears or are struggling to pay your mortgage and need answers to avoid repossession from happening.</p>

                <p>We'll look at the process of repossession and other associated topics to help you at this difficult time.</p>

                <p>Let's get stuck in.</p>

                <h5>What happens if I miss one mortgage payment?</h5>

                <p>If you miss your monthly mortgage payment, your lender will contact you; usually within 15 days of the amount being overdue.</p>

                <p>However, you don't want to wait for them to call. Be proactive and contact your lender as soon as possible so as to reduce the risk of repossession.</p>

                <p>It's very important for you to make the first move and initiate talks with your lender.</p>

                <p>Don't miss repayments without talking to your lender first. Missing a repayment without immediately informing your lender will trigger the arrears issue, and start the clock ticking towards repossession.</p>

                <p>That's why taking action sooner rather than later is crucial when it comes to missed mortgage payments and repossession.</p>

                <p>So if you are worried about how many mortgage payments it'll take before repossession occurs, don't ignore the problem. It will not go away.</p>

                <h5>Will repossession start immediately if I miss a mortgage payment?</h5>

                <p>Lenders must use repossession only as a final resort, and there's an agreement in place that the major lenders won't commence repossession proceedings until at least three months of arrears have occurred, and you have been referred to an independent debt advisor for help.</p>

                <p>Although being in arrears does mean that your home could be repossessed by the bank or your lender, repossession doesn't happen overnight. The repossession process can take several months before a court order is made. During this time, you can attempt to stop the repossession by being proactive.</p>

                <p>However, you should remember that the repossession process effectively begins after the first missed mortgage payment because if you are not able to afford the first missed payment, it's unlikely you are able to afford subsequent mortgage payments.</p>

                <p>More missed mortgage payments means going further into arrears, but it was the first missed payment that triggered the repossession process.</p>

                <p>Unless you make good on this first missed mortgage payment (by repaying it), or you agree with your lender to either add the amount to your mortgage, or pay it off over time, your lender will continue with the repossession process; especially if you fail to communicate with them.</p>

                <h5>If I can't afford my mortgage, what can I do to avoid my house being repossessed?</h5>

                <p>Before the process gets as far as repossession, you have to be as proactive as possible and ask your lender about alternative options that can be implemented to help reduce the amount you need to pay each month. These could include:</p>

                <div class="link-more">

                </div>


                <p>However, if your financial issues are more permanent, they may refer you to their loss mitigation department. This could mean modifying your mortgage loan, or selling your house. Although this may seem like a daunting and scary prospect, it is preferable to defaulting payment on your mortgage and risking repossession.</p>

                <p>This is why it is essential to speak to your lender to work out the best options for you and your situation.</p>

                <p>If you are financially aware and act quickly, you shouldn't have to worry about missing mortgage payments leading to repossession of your home. However, it's not something that should be brushed under the carpet.</p>
