                    <p>
                        Buying a property is the biggest financial commitment to make,
                        it is recommended that you have a survey done to ensure you are
                        aware of any possible issues that may arise after you have moved in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are obtaining a mortgage, the mortgage lender will complete
                        a valuation on the property. The majority of lenders do charge you as
                        the buyer for this however this is purely for their purpose to ensure
                        that they are securing their finance on a suitable property. It is possible
                        to complete a more comprehensive survey at the same time as the mortgage
