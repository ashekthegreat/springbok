                    <div class="comment">Absolutely Brilliant!!! The house was on the market at 4pm one day and sold at 11am the next day. Could I ask for better? NO. I got the price I wanted as well! There were other properties in the same area and they had been up for months. Thank you to Springbok for getting my property sold so quickly and efficiently.</div>

                    <div class="comment">I went to springbok as my property wasn't getting any interest at all with a local agent, wow i never expected the response I got. I can honestly say I will always recommend this company. They definitely are a cut above the average estate agent; a very happy seller thanks.</div>

                    <div class="comment">Actually the most amazing experience we have ever had, these guys are not 'estate agents' in the true sense of the word, they are totally on your side, totally human, and fantastic, every part of the process from the valuation to completion was exceptional I can't sing their praises enough.</div>
