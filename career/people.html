                            I came from a telesales company and had no prior background in property sales. The training was great, ensuring I hit the ground running, which was a great surprise as I was worried the learning curve would be huge.
                            My friend Hazel, who I worked with, recommended Springbok and told me how great the environment was, despite it being a sales environment. To be honest, I was dubious, but from the moment I started, I could tell there was something different and that feeling has never left me… here I am, 5 months on, thanking my lucky stars that I applied and got the job, waking up every morning with no worries and enjoying being part of such a good team. Strong work ethics and being treated with respect and decency is all anyone can ask for. I love what I do and I know I get to pick up the phone every day and help someone.

                            I joined Springbok two years ago. At the time, there was me out and about and 4 people office-based. Fast forward to two years later and there are 9 of me scattered around the country – Scotland, Wales, the Midlands, etc. – and in excess of 30 people in the office. The reason we have grown so much is due to offering something different from a traditional estate agent and being incredibly proactive.
                            The plan over the next 1 - 2 years is to double our work force again. This could only happen because we stick to our principles by delivering what we say, but also doing it with great customer service.
                            I genuinely love my job. Every day is different because every property is different and every vendor is different. The variation is the key… no two days will ever be the same. It suits me personally because I'm a self-confessed geek when it comes to property. It's a job people should be passionate about.
                            I have friends who do various different jobs, from call centre work to plumbing and one who's senior management at a huge supermarket distribution warehouse. Out of them all, I work longer hours than anyone, but I'm also the only one who doesn't dread Monday morning and leaves the house with a smile on my face in the morning.

                            A friend gave my contact details to a property recruitment company which matched me with Springbok. I felt it was a risk joining Springbok after comparing them with my then-employer. After long discussions with the director, I soon realised that the company was just as strong, there was no real risk and a move could only be beneficial to me and my career.
                            I have been impressed with how the director is very approachable and is willing listen to your ideas and opinions. The company gives you license to do your job as you feel you need to, and trusts you as an employee to do your job without fear.

                            As soon as I started working for Springbok Properties, I knew I would love it here; the atmosphere and my colleagues were friendly and made me feel a part of the team from my first day.
                            Exactly a week from my start date, I was run over as I left work. I had to take quite a bit of time off to fully recover from the accident. Initially, I was worried about having so much time off just as I had started, but my manager was extremely caring and made sure I came back to work when I felt I was ready and didn't rush it. Again, after I came back to work, all my colleagues made me feel welcome and comfortable, and helped me recover from my accident.
                            I have now worked for Springbok Properties for a year and a month and I have already had three chances to progress. I managed to grab the third one and I am now an Assistant Listings Manager. I genuinely love my job and colleagues and I will not be leaving for the foreseeable future. Springbok is by far the best career choice I have made. I do not regret any of my time here. I have and will carry on recommending Springbok to potential work colleagues and vendors alike. For a fair and enjoyable work experience I would recommend Springbok 100%!!!

                            After spending my time working for various property companies, I decided two years ago to go for an interview with rather an unknown entity in Springbok. Whilst the interview took place with the owner, I quickly realised that this was a company that was 'going places' and, although I had job offers from two other businesses, I decided to gamble because it felt right.
                            When I started my performance for the first two to three months was less than inspiring, but where other companies would start look to find a replacement, Springbok persevered with me.
                            With hard work and the support of the excellent teams/my friends in the company, I am now on a financial package that most of my friends would love. I'm really looking forward to my second holiday this year which is to Canada…

                        <div class="people-story">
                            I joined Springbok in February 2013. I joined her with very little experience when it comes to sales, but since joining the help and support I have received from colleagues has enabled me to progress my career much quicker than I originally thought. I have received training in all aspects of the job, from sales experience to communications skills, and being part of such a supportive team has been fantastic.
                            Within the Springbok team, it feels more like a family than work colleagues. If there was ever an issue, I could speak to numerous people and always felt like I had the support of my managers.
                            From day one I was made to feel at home. I have managed to progress into an Assistant Manager role within the space of 7 months. Springbok has more than tripled in size since I joined and we will continue to grow until, I believe, we will be the best fast sale specialist in the country.
                            Joining Springbok was the best career move I have made. I would recommend it to anyone who has the desire and ambition to grab the best opportunity to have a successful property career.

                            I ended up working for Springbok because last year I put an offer in on a property I found through Right Move, being marketed by Springbok. Although my offer was not accepted, I remembered the company due to how proactive and how quick they were to respond to my enquiries. When I was made redundant from my previous job, naturally I wanted to get back in to an estate agency and applied to Springbok. I've been happy since…

                            Since I left school in 2003, I have been in many working environments – banking, health insurance, NHS and various temping jobs. I got to a point in my life where I wanted a different career, so I headed down the Holiday Rep path.
                            After my first season working away, I came back to the UK and was successful in securing a role at an estate agency as a Sales Administrator. I was there for 4 months and then I decided to go back overseas for another summer season. I cam back for the winter and started looking for permanent positions to settle in the UK, as I had been in and out of jobs for the past couple of years.
                            A colleague I had worked with at an estate agency let me know that the company she works for was looking for Sales Administrators. I had experience of working in an estate agency previously, as well over 10 years administration experience. It turned out this company was Springbok Properties. I came in for an interview with the managing director of the company. Shepherd trusted me when I said I was back to stay in the UK, despite my job history.
                            I feel that working at Springbok, I have landed on my feet after being in and out of jobs the past few years. I am very happy and settled in my job and I no longer wake up with that dreaded feeling in my stomach of having to go to work. No two working days are the same and while it's pressure to hit our targets, it's very stimulating and challenging, and I most definitely enjoy it.

                            My head had previously been filled with a lot of negativity and bad press regarding Springbok Properties the company, but I found out for myself that what I'd been told was far from the truth.
                            I was the top performer/earner in my previous company, and therefore in a very secure role. I was headhunted by Springbok and the challenge was too big to resist. The atmosphere within the sales teams and throughout the company is like nothing I've experienced before. Every employee is treated and valued as an individual, as opposed to simply a number. They all have the utmost respect for one another, and nobody has a bad word to say about senior management – something I certainly wasn't used to!!
                            The main importance for Springbok Properties is the results, not what people are wearing to work or how long they take to make a cup of tea! Nobody is man-managed, they are treated like the adults they are.
                            I was promoted to Sales Manager within 5 months. This was a brand new role for me. I am still learning every day as I am yet to be in this role 12 months. Shepherd and Springbok Properties have been nothing but loyal, supportive and most of all, patient. I've made mistakes along the way and I've learnt a huge amount. When mistakes have been made in any department we discuss them as a management team and look for solutions – rather than pointing the finger and judging one another. I can truly say moving to Springbok Properties was the best career move I've made.

                            I started working at Springbok Properties in April, 2013. Since then I have been given nothing but opportunities to go further in the company. I started as a support negotiator and, within a month, I was promoted to a senior negotiator and trained in this role.
                            My first two months in this role were challenging but something I was more than capable of getting the hang of. As well as being given training, I listened to calls to see how each person would deal with different scenarios. This helped me a lot as it was real-world experience which I used to put together my own style of being a negotiator.
                            Springbok Properties has constantly offered me support in terms of where I am and what I need to improve, through one-to-one and group meetings. This has helped my sales techniques – and my confidence and monthly figures are improving!
                            Springbok is a fast-growing company which means it is full of opportunities for promotion. All in all, my time at Springbok so far has been a great experience and I would recommend the company to anyone.

                            Springbok Properties has given me a great opportunity to develop myself and my career. I applied in the summer of 2013 and straight away got the role I had been passed over for in other companies. I was finally a Property Sales Consultant!
                            I have done very well in my role and have already been promoted in only seven months – and seen my wages double in a single year. I'm over the moon! I'm now a regional valuer, which means I have the best of both desk work and getting out of the office to meet clients. I have learnt not to settle and always go after what I want!
                            I am glad I applied for a job here. They gave me the opportunity I wasn't getting anywhere else. My voice and effort count for something and the company cares about me. The company is also expanding and there is lots of opportunity.

                        <div class="people-story">
                            I joined Springbok after working closely with the sales progression department, while I was working for one of their panel of solicitors. I was impressed by their commitment and attitude to work, together with what their staff had to say about the company and its management. I was also impressed by the emphasis they put on customer service. It was clear they understood the importance of customer satisfaction, so I decided I was ready for a new challenge and I haven't looked back since.
                            One of the main things that attracted me was the increase in salary, together with the commission-based pay system (which is rare for solicitors, certainly at paralegal level). This benefit is substantially responsible for me now being in a position to save for a deposit for my first house and obtain a mortgage, which would have been completely out of the question before Springbok. I enjoy the personal satisfaction of hitting targets and the friendly competition with my colleagues, but I believe the fair commission structure also encourages success and achievement.
                            I appreciate the fact that I am working for a rapidly expanding company that recognises and rewards hard work and ambition, and is keen to develop staff and promote from within whenever possible. I have been promoted within my first year with the company and believe this reflects the company's values.
                            Since I joined Springbok I have learnt a great many things that you would have expected to learn at a company like this. Surprisingly, I have also found great enjoyment in dealing with cases with the opportunity to be innovative and help people to get positive outcomes when they were in otherwise difficult circumstances, such as stopping repossession by securing a quick sale and sensitive cases involving divorce or bereavement.
                            It is great to work for a company that properly values team work and I personally benefit from working with enthusiastic and supportive colleagues. Despite the fact that the work load is often demanding, I can honestly say that I look forward to going to work every morning.

                            I was the first sales progressor in the company. The minute I joined Springbok, I could tell I was part of something special, even though there were only a handful of staff when I started. I felt that each staff member had ambition and their hearts individually were in this business – they believed in it and trusted that it would become successful.
                            There were excellent business values in place and achievable business plans to aim for. I have never looked back since I started, and I can honestly say that being part of the "Springbok family" has been the best decision I have ever made in my working career.
                            I firmly believe that you should be happy in your job, want to get up every morning and go to work for a company that values you. In turn you respect that company and want to help it to succeed and grow, and I truly believe that I have achieved that.
                            I have been in estate agency for about 10 years, and never have I felt so valued, respected and trusted. Above all, I feel I am a piece of a work of art that, put together with the all the other pieces, makes a potential masterpiece which, in the years to come, will increase in value and public demand.
                            I finally feel secure in my working career – so secure, in fact, that I am about to embark on my very own home owner journey. I am about to purchase my first home and I have managed to do this through hard work and dedication. The belief I have in this company has given me the security to take this step onto the property ladder and I could not be happier and more settled.
                            Springbok pride themselves on the staff they choose. They know what they want in their candidates and will take measures to assure they have it before they make their selection.

                        <div class="people-story">
                            I was working as a Senior Sales Negotiator/Team Leader, but I felt for me to achieve my goal – which at the time was to become a sales manager – I needed to leave. So I applied to Springbok Properties for the same role. I wanted to get straight back into property so was interested to see what they could offer. I met with Shepherd for my interview and he sold me his vision for Springbok and what the future would hold. It was something that I bought into instantly. During that meeting I made it clear to him that my ambition was to be a sales manager and he assured me that opportunities for the right individuals would be available as we grew and expanded.
                            I started with Springbok at the end of October 2012 and was the third negotiator to join the company. Within 5 months, I set the company sales record, selling 27 properties in March 2013. As the company grew, I grew with it. I was promoted to Team Leader in June 2013 and then, at the end of November 2013, the position of Sales Manager came available. After a tough interview process and having to compete with some stiff competition, I managed to finally achieve the goal I had set myself three years earlier and am now the Sales Manager for the Negotiators.
                            At Springbok, you are treated as an individual and not just a number and your opinion or idea – no matter how big or small – is listened to.  I have only been with the company for 16 months, but in that time I've achieved my initial goal and my earning potential has increased massively. I've worked hard and it's certainly paying off. For me it's been a great journey so far - who knows what the future holds!

                            My job was very stressful and going to work became more and more of a challenge. I knew that, once I started to feel like I didn't want to be there, it was time to look for something new. Springbok offered me an interview and then the job, the very same day. They respected my experience and understood that I was unsure as to whether or not to go into another agency.
                            After just one day, I realised that it was the best decision I had made in a very long time. The company has a brilliant business model and is growing month by month. They really care about the people they have working for them and take the time out of their day to really get to know you. It is such a refreshing change; I cannot believe I didn't make this move earlier. They allow me to do the job that I am good at without increased stress or worry in the back of my mind.
                            For anyone who has a passion for property and the will to always want more, this is the company for you. They reward you with great pay and more incentives than you can handle. They care about you as an individual and how you feel about the place you work. I have never had this experience before and now enjoy coming to work and giving 110% every day, as I know that the company is working that hard for me in return.

                            I started off with a solicitor as an office junior and was promoted very swiftly to Legal Assistant, doing all parts of the conveyancing process. I loved the job but, sadly, the recession happened and the company eventually had to let me go. I went to work for an estate agent. Being from a conveyancing firm, this felt like I had taken a huge step back and a kick in the teeth. I promised myself it would only be temporary. I worked very hard and, after 6 months, I had got my first promotion. Then I fell unexpectedly pregnant.
                            Maternity leave started and I had never felt so good in my life. No more of that place for another 7 months – I was so relieved even though I was on the verge of popping and starting a stressful house renovation with my partner! Time went so fast and, before I knew it, I was due back at work in three months. I felt sick at the thought.
                            Then I had a phone call from Shepherd, who gave me the hope and excitement of a better life and future with my little family. I have worked at Springbok now for over a year and truly loved every minute of it. I give my all for this company and I receive the same in return. They say the grass isn't greener on the other side, I say it is. They say you can't have it both ways, family and career, I say you can. I've got a managerial position, I have the most supportive partner and gorgeous little girl and I am earning more and more money. Life is great!

                            Whenever anyone changes jobs, they always wonder whether they have done the right thing. It's not always a simple case of "the grass is greener", either, as was the case for me. What could possibly be better than completing the first 12 months at your job, being a success, having a good, regular income and - above all - being comfortable? The key word there is "comfort": are you happy to accept comfort over progression? In my case, I wasn't.
                            I had just moved home, I was earning very good money and I was working with a lot of people who had become friends. But something didn't sit right for me. Broken promises, goal posts being moved and the overall feeling that no matter what you did, it wasn't good enough… all of this put doubts in my mind about my future being the job where I was "comfortable".
                            So I took the plunge and I truly believe that I have found a company that values my passion. I am now working in a more relaxed atmosphere, with successful people who know what is expected of them, and who don't have the stress of being micromanaged. But I am also working for a company that values my opinion and respects my industry knowledge. Even though Springbok is a successful company that has grown massively, they still appreciate the fact that I have useful experience that can help this already amazing business grow further.
                            I have just entered my 6th week at Springbok, so some may think I have rose-tinted glasses on, but trust me when I say that, in all my years of working in the sales industry, I have never been this valued. Moving to the progressive unknown from the so-called comfort I was in is the best decision I have ever made in my working life.
                            My advice to anyone thinking about joining the Springbok family is "do not hesitate". What the owners, managers and staff have built here is special… and it is only going to get better.
