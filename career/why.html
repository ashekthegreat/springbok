                    Innovative. Progressive. Exciting. Rewarding. These are some of the words our
                    employees commonly use to describe their jobs. As a Springbok employee you are
                    encouraged to think creatively & produce performances that are out of the ordinary.
                    You work with some of the industry's most advanced minds and are part of a
                    high-impact service. No matter what your role is at Springbok, you help mold
                    the future face of the property industry.
                </p>

                <div class="basic-content pad-left-35">

                    <h4>Ground-breaking service</h4>
                    <p>Transformative premium service that turns the intricate process of selling properties into a simple, pleasurable and hassle-free experience for both buyers and sellers. We have been challenging tradition in every aspect of our property selling service. We take pride in getting our clients the best possible price, in the shortest possible time.</p>

                    <h4>Great team</h4>
                    <p>Springbok is a collective of like-minded, growth-oriented and inspiring individuals who believe in providing the best possible standards of services - and who are well-rewarded for bringing perfection to every aspect of their work.</p>

                    <h4>Growth and progression opportunities</h4>
                    <p>As a fast-growing company, we have endless progression opportunities for achievers and performers who aim to rise to management level. We help them sharpen their skill sets to produce and extract exceptional performances.</p>

                    <h4>Distinct powerful brand</h4>
                    <p>With our rapid expansion, amazing reviews and growing popularity, it is only a matter of time before Springbok becomes a household name for property sales.</p>

                    <h4>World-class training</h4>
                    <p>Every Springbok employee is provided with world-class training, not only focusing on their job role, but also on improving individual productivity, goal-setting and time management. Plus, we provide ongoing hands-on and workshop training. We believe we have the best training in the industry, bar none.</p>

                    <h4>Excellent basic, uncapped commission</h4>
                    <p>Guaranteed commission for 4-6 months to match your current earnings, while you build your own commission pipeline - we will match your current salary from day one. The Springbok Properties uncapped commission structure is a perfect example of the old adage "You get out what you put in."</p>

                    <h4>Parking, car allowance, bonuses, nights out, holidays, etc.</h4>
                    <p>We pay for parking, so that saves you a grand in before-tax earnings  a year, for starters. We have numerous quarterly bonuses where the whole team benefits, not just one or two individuals. But we also believe in a healthy work-life balance, so we encourage and even organise nights out and holidays to make sure you're taking time for leisure as well as ambition.</p>

                    <h4>Great customer reviews</h4>
                    <p>What we do matters. Buying a house is one of the most important transactions in a person's life – some people only do it once in their whole life. Our work changes lives, so we always aim to do it better than anyone else.</p>
                    <p>We won five All Agent awards in 2013, including Best Agent for customer service. We are the top agency in Manchester and 12th out of 21,204 branches in the whole country. These awards are based on what really matters – customer reviews, not internal industry measures.</p>

                    <h4>Consistent feedback</h4>
                    <p>We do not take your happiness for granted or assume all is well. We are always working hard to ensure the team is happy. We gather anonymous feedback on our workplace environment and our management every quarter, and we use that feedback to improve.</p>

                    <h4>Clear purpose, job satisfaction</h4>
                    <p>At Springbok, the "Monday morning moan" is about traffic or the weather, not the job. We feel good coming to work because we know we're changing lives, we know our work matters and we know our employer and colleagues respect and value us.</p>
